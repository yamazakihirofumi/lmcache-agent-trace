This repo is meant to run a series of experiments to collect trace data from AI agents. And further use the data to analyze the performance of the agents, following the idea from https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache/issues/1826.

**Important note**: If the agent is powered by an OPENAI model, the traces will be automatically tracked from the [OpenAI API Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/logs). Collecting traces should be easy.

| Project Name | Status | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| [Terminus 1&2](https://www.tbench.ai/terminus) | ✅ | From [terminal bench](https://www.tbench.ai/) and [harbor](https://harborframework.com/docs/running-tbench) project, source code open; Basically the agent context management is to append new round conversation on all the previous chat history. Because of this nature, prefix and non-prefix cache hit rates should be stricly the same. Each step, it plans and executes multiple functions in sequential order. Easy to collect traces. |
| [Mini-swe-agent](https://github.com/SWE-agent/mini-swe-agent) | ✅ | Running this agent with the [terminal bench](https://www.tbench.ai/) and [harbor](https://harborframework.com/docs/running-tbench), the only difference between Terminus 1&2 is that Mini-swe-agent plans and executes one bash command(or multiple ones with '&&' but rarely happens) at one time, while Terminus 1&2 plans multiple commands and executes them in sequential order. So the context reuse pattern is very similar to Terminus 1&2. |
